# Neural Networks

## Introduction

This repo is for learning purposes only. It contains the code for my personal implementation of a neural network.
I'll leave everything here, from the first steps to the final implementation.

My code is full of comments, so it should be easy to understand. I'll also leave some links to the resources I used to learn about neural networks.

This repo is written in Python 3.11. I'll probably rewrite it in C++ later.

## How to use

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Numpy
- Visual Studio Code (optional)

### Running the code

- Clone the repo
- Open the repo in Visual Studio Code
- My code is written in Jupyter Notebooks, so you'll need to install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- All recommended extensions should be installed automatically, but if they aren't, you can install them manually searching for `@recommended` in the extensions tab

## FAQ

### Why are you doing this?

I'm doing this to learn about neural networks. I'm a computer science student and I'm really interested in AI, so I decided to learn about neural networks.
My goal here is to share my learning process with others, so they can learn with me.

### Why are you using Python?

First of all I don't really know Python, I'm learning it as I go. I'm using Python because it's a really simple language and it's easy to learn.

### Why are you using Jupyter Notebooks?

I'm using Jupyter Notebooks because it's a really simple way to write and run Python code. It's also really easy to share the code with others.

### How can I contribute?

You can contribute by opening an issue or a pull request. I'll be really happy to receive any kind of feedback.
